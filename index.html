<b>Candle Kayeee</b>

When I was eleven my mom,my brother,and my step dad moved back to Iowa.We lived in a shelter there for 3 months,I had one friend we went everywhere together and even went to the same school, lived in the same shelter,we lived on the same row.

 Three years went by full of memories we were best friends even sisters,we had a big party coming up at school so we went clothes shopping.She tried on stuff first and she tried on a backless shirt.As she turned to go in to change she had a variety of bruises, they were purple, red, black, e.t.c.

 I would try to ask her what happened over the weeks she would never tell me.It seemed like her situation at home was getting worse, but everyone’s situation in the shelter was worse. Her’s was weird,she was always on punishment or she couldn’t go anywhere. 
Who was I to tell her parents how to raise their daughter, so I just minded my business.Weeks past she was really quiet,at school and the shelter.We would have conversations but they weren’t too regular.We stopped going to a lot of places together,stopped seeing each other so much.Yet again weeks past, everything was quiet.

On March 8th her mother called, crying and stuttering saying that she had been rushed to the hospital, she had overdosed on prescription drugs. My mom rushed me to the hospital her mother was the first person I saw in E.R. 

Everything she was said sounded like mumbling,like music playing in the distance,like a ring of a doorbell.

She looked sad, but I couldn’t pay her any attention.When the doctor came out it was like a filter lifted off of a picture, like a blur...

The doctor stood for a minute and like a movie they said “There was nothing they could do” and like always there was that one lady that screams and cries. I wish I could be that lady to show the slightest bit of sympathy for my bestfriend, I couldn’t, I just couldn’t.

My mother took me back to the shelter to get sleep, all I could do is blame myself for not asking more questions,for minding my business, thinking she needed space when all she really needed was a friend. I still think it's my fault,everyone says it's not but nobody could tell me.

The next few weeks after her death, it was a daze, her mother never spoke and her father moved. I never really knew him he was really quiet and never said anything to anyone, but I always heard him hollering from next door I never actually paid any attention.

 Her mother was weird, weary, and scary, she always seemed worried but she was a nice person.We never found out but I was pretty sure it had something to do with her father, but I can't judge because I never knew him.Look at me being a detective. We moved back to Chicago and  we always visit Iowa.My friend will forever be missed,her grave is my first visit there.I miss her no one can ever fill her shoes....


Jade we miss you.

             <h3>Coding It</h3>
              <p>The part that got pretty tricky was actually coding it. I created a series of "div" tags in HTML. These were basically fillers for the shapes I would make. I used CSS to select the div tags, and give them shape and color.
              I layered different shapes on top of each other to create some of the more complex shapes.</p>
